# Vitruvius Design+Build next.js challenge

## Overview
Welcome to the Open Library Search Challenge! In this project, you will create a Next.js application that leverages the Open Library API to provide a book search functionality. This application should allow users to search for books, display the results, and view detailed information about each book by using the unique key provided by the API. The project should focus on both functionality and user experience.

## Objectives
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature using the Open Library Search API (https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search).

- **Detailed View**: Enable users to view detailed information about a book by selecting it from the search results.
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination for the search results.
- **User Experience**: Design the interface to be intuitive and user-friendly.

## Requirements
- **Framework**: Use Next.js for the project.
- **API Integration**: Utilize the Open Library API for fetching book data.
- **Responsiveness**: The application should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Documentation**: Include a README.md file with clear instructions on how to set up and run the project.
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, readable, and well-structured code.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control.

## Submission
- **Repository**: Push your code to a public GitHub repository.
- **Email**: Once you have completed the challenge, email the link to your GitHub repository to izzy@vitruvius.design.
- **Deadline**: The challenge must be submitted by Friday, Feb 2.
